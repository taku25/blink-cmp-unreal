`blink-cmp-unreal` is a [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp) source designed to accelerate C++ development in Unreal Engine. It accurately recognizes the macro at the current cursor position (such as `UCLASS`, `UPROPERTY`, etc.) and intelligently provides only relevant specifiers as completion candidates.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Context-Aware Completion**: Intelligently provides only the specifiers relevant to the macro at the current cursor position (`UCLASS`, `UPROPERTY`, `UFUNCTION`, `USTRUCT`, `UENUM`, `UINTERFACE`).
*   **Inline Documentation**: Each completion item is accompanied by documentation explaining the role of the specifier.
*   **Highly Configurable**: Easily enable or disable completion for specific macros to fit your workflow.

## üîß Requirements

*   Neovim v0.9.0 or later
*   [**blink.cmp**](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp) (**required**)

## üöÄ Installation

Install with your favorite plugin manager.

### [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
-- lua/plugins/completion.lua (or your blink.cmp config file)
return {
  {
    "Saghen/blink.cmp",
    dependencies = {
      -- Add blink-cmp-unreal as a dependency
      { "taku25/blink-cmp-unreal" },
    },
    opts = {
      sources = {
        -- Enable the "unreal" source
        default = { "lsp", "buffer", "path", "unreal" },
        providers = {
          unreal = {
            module = "blink-cmp-unreal",
            name = "unreal",
            score_offset = 15,
            filetypes = { "cpp", "h" },
          },
        },
      },
      --... other blink.cmp settings
    },
  },
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You can customize the plugin's behavior by passing an `opts` table within the `dependencies` section in `lazy.nvim`.

By default, completion for all macros is enabled.

```lua
-- Example: Disable completion for USTRUCT and UENUM
{
  "Saghen/blink.cmp",
  dependencies = {
    {
      "taku25/blink-cmp-unreal",
      opts = {
        enable_ustruct = false,
        enable_uenum = false,
      },
    },
  },
  -- ... other settings
}
```
